I executed dashboard-app tutorial by next.js version 14. Its a kindful step-by-step tasklist with quizzes and, mostly because of next's hot reload, it compiles very fast.

I also made screenshots from code and principal tips on using next 14. I'll share it later.

# Default tutorial's README

        This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

        For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
